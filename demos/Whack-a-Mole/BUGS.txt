Bugs and issues with the game:

- With the 2020.08.22 patch of the kernel, removing the global "mx" and "my"
  variables, the game might no longer work with an actual mouse. The patch was
  necessary since the project ceased to compile with recent (10.1.0) versions
  of gcc, and was added in this manner since such short global identifiers are
  not good practice. The problem should be fixed by the usage of the kernel's
  GetMouseX() and GetMouseY() functions.
